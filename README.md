# Personal Accounting

I have built this web application in order to practice my C# ASP.NET skills. The main objective of this app is to make keeping track of personal cash flow simple. This application can record transactions in four currencies including GBP, EUR, and USD.
Users can use the application anywhere on their phone, tablet or laptop, due to it's responsive design. 

**Features:**
 * CRUD database
 * Responsive design

**User manual:**
 1. On the home the recent balance of each currency is shown. Through the buttons below them, the transaction history is available.
 2. By clicking on the "Add transactions" button, and filling out a form users can record a transaction.
 3. By clicking on the "Add stocks" button, and filling out a form users can record a stock transaction.
 4. On each page, which shows the transactions of stock or a particular currency an edit and delete option is available. 
 5. The header on top, allows users to easily navigate through the application.
